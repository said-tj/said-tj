## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m an Applied Mathematics graduate with a strong interest in data analysis, applied statistics, and machine learning.

I enjoy working with Python and R to clean, analyze, and model data, transforming raw data into meaningful insights and clear visualizations. My mathematical background allows me to approach problems analytically and understand models beyond their surface-level implementation.

I am currently seeking opportunities as a **Data Analyst or Junior Data Scientist**, where I can continue learning and contribute to data-driven projects.
